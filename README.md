## Heya, I'm insaves (You can call me Saves or just Rin)!
<img align="right" width="6.5%" src="https://i.ibb.co/8z76419/nikodance.gif">

I'm a self-taught 16-year-old Software Engineer with about 4 years of experience. I enjoy working on personal projects in my free time. I love learning new things and involving myself in topics that seem fun and pique my interest.

In addition to coding, I love playing games, such as shooters, souls-likes and anything I get invited to.
